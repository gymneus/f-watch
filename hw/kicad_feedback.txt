General
-------------------------------------------

* Menus should contains ALL the options/features (someone learning, like me, will just browse the menu to look for something).
* 


Kicad (project explorer)
-------------------------------------------

* Can't delete "sub-project" .pro files.
* I was confused not to see hierachical schematic sheet here.
* 


Component Libray Editor
--------------------------------------------

* Selection tool is not user frendly.
* Missing action on group (e.g. rotate selected pins).
* Can't change lines color.
* Block copy, copies the object at the same place. Not following the cursor (like in Eeschma).
* 


Module editor
--------------------------------------------

* Missing measurement tool (usefull to check a footprint).
* Missing copy/paste.
* Selection tool is not user frendly.
* Missing snap to object + snap on all layers.
* Missing interactive resize objects (e.g. drag the end of a line to extend it).
* Missing double-clic to select text in textboxes.
* Scroll should be vertical pan
* Ctrl+Scroll should be zoom
* Shift+Scroll should be horizontal pan
* Missing change parameter of an object group (e.g. X position)
* Y axis negative value is up, Y axis positive value is down !?!
* It would be nicer to select the layer to work on instead of having to select the layer for every object.
* Missing keepout area in modules.
* Bug, doesn't redraw after placing an object (have to zoom in/out).
* Solder mask drawing (if this is the red lines around the pad) is not updated when the value is change for a component or a pad.
* Paste stencil isn't drawn.
* Missing displayed layer selection.
* 


Eeschema
----------------------------------------------

* The way the schematic files are managed inside a project is far from being intuitive!
* Libraries should be defined globaly, not per schematic file.
* Doesn't ask for a file name when saving (very confusing).
* Creates schematic project (.pro) from within Eeschema ?!?!
* Some function are only available as icons (not in menus).
* Zoom doesn't adjust when resizing the window (zoom=fit -> resize -> zoom!=fit).
* When click "Place component" I was expecting a window to pop up to select a component, instead of have to click first somewhere on the sheet.
* Bug, when placing a component that exists in another library (with the same name) it doesn't place the selected one (e.g. resistor).
* Bug, double-click on a component, it asks for clarification, when clarified don't open pop-up window.
* Drawing straight line when dragging wire, not exactly what we want.
* Can't freely name power nets.
* 


CvPcb
-------------------------------------------------

* Missing multiple selection (to assign the same footprint to all selected components).
* Can't undo association (only overwrite).
* Can't re-load module library.
* 


Pcbnew
----------------------------------------------------

* Can't re-load module library?
* Component search function not working? (first search says found, click second time says not found).
  -> Should zoom to component.
* Undo segfaults!!!
* Can't change track width when routing is active.
* Copy/paste is missing.
* ALWAYS CRASHES !!! (segfault)
* Missing easy change width of tracks.
* Missing select entire track or connected copper.
* Missing snap on all layers.
* Precise component placement (manually enter position).
* Can't place via freely (when not routing).
* Can't easily display top or bottom layers only.
* KEEPS CRASHING !!! (segfault)
* Select "Dwgs.User" layer, select graphic line tool -> sometimes tool doesn't follow the mouse.
* Missing snap via to trace end.
* Missing round keepout area (basically the keepout should be a layer and we should be able to draw any graphics on it).
* Missing lock graphic drawings.
* Can't place a via inside a pad without a trace connected to it (e.g. thermal pads).
* Moving grid origin doesn't work (origin stays at top left corner of the page).
* Missing feature to quickly show a single layer.
* Missing fill zone manager.
* Fill zone: - can't differenciate between baord edge and via/pads clearance.
             - via/pad clearance is calculated from annular ring, not from hole.
* Can't change layers color??
* Can't place (non-plated) holes, have to place a module.
* DRC option not taking the unit selection (mm, inches) into account.
* 

OpenGL

* Can't read net name inside pad on selected components.
* When moving component to bottom, some 'shadow' persists on the top.
* Can't selectively remove ratsnest from component.
* Double click on an object should open the property dialog.
* Place origin doesn't work.
* Grid isn't aligned with default canevas mode!!
* Can route through keepout area!
* Can't resize trace (drag the end).
* Bottom solder mask is under top copper and solder mask when bottom layer is selected.
* Ratsnest not refresh when re-loading the netlist.
* Component lock doesn't work (can still move locked components).
* Dwgs.User layer is alway drawn on top of other layers (and it shouldn't).
* Missing display net name in vias.
* When placing via, router isn't swaping to other layer.
*
