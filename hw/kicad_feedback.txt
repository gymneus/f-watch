Kicad (project explorer)
-------------------------------------------

* Can't delete "sub-project" .pro files.
* I was confused not to see hierachical schematic sheet here.
* 




Component Libray Editor
--------------------------------------------

* Selection tool is not user frendly.
* Missing action on group (e.g. rotate selected pins).
* 


Module editor
--------------------------------------------

* Missing measurement tool (usefull to check a footprint).
* Missing copy/paste.
* Selection tool is not user frendly.
* Missing snap to object + snap on all layers.
* Missing interactive resize objects (e.g. drag the end of a line to extend it).
* Missing double-clic to select text in textboxes.
* Scroll should be vertical pan
* Ctrl+Scroll should be zoom
* Shift+Scroll should be horizontal pan
* Missing change parameter of an object group (e.g. X position)
* Y axis negative value is up, Y axis positive value is down !?!
* It would be nicer to select the layer to work on instead of having to select the layer for every object.
* Missing keepout area in modules.
* Bug, doesn't redraw after placing an object (have to zoom in/out).
* Solder mask drawing (if this is the red lines around the pad) is not updated when the value is change for a component or a pad.
* Paste stencil isn't drawn.
* Missing displayed layer selection.
* 


Eeschema
----------------------------------------------

* The way the schematic files are managed inside a project is far from being intuitive!
* Libraries should be defined globaly, not per schematic file.
* Doesn't ask for a file name when saving (very confusing).
* Creates schematic project (.pro) from within Eeschema ?!?!
* Some function are only available as icons (not in menus).
* Zoom doesn't adjust when resizing the window (zoom=fit -> resize -> zoom!=fit).
* When click "Place component" I was expecting a window to pop up to select a component, instead of have to click first somewhere on the sheet.
